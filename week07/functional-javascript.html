      <h1>Functional JavaScript</h1>
      <section>
      <h2>What is functional programming?</h2>
        <p>As a programmer, I try to keep my code clean by
        following the functional style as much as possible. Whereas
        a traditional imperative approach to programming focuses on
        the steps a program should follow, a functional approach
        focuses on the mathematical aspects of programming. I
        think <a href="https://www.lispcast.com">Eric
        Normand</a> does a good job explaining the theory
        behind functional programming in his podcast, <a
        href="https://www.lispcast.com/category/podcast/">Thoughts on
        Functional Programming</a>. To summarize his explanation,
        functional programmers separate their work into data,
        calculations, and actions. Data is information being
        processed. Calculations are ways of consistently transforming
        data. Actions are things a program does based on the given
        transformed data. In my personal opinion, lispy languages provide
        the best flexibility and consistency in the functional style
        because their simple grammar provide a lot of power.</p>
      <p>In contrast with lisp, which has a strong functional focus,
      JavaScript has had an inescapable strong imperative focus. Back
      in the early days of HTML5 when I first learned JavaScript, all
      functions, even the anonymous kind, had a return clause, and there
      was a strong focus on things like DOM manipulation, AJAX, and
      drawing to a canvas. Since then, a lot has been added that makes
      functional programming much more concise. An anonymous function
      declared with <code>function(x){return x+1;}</code> can now be
      declared <code>x=&gt;x+1</code>, which is much more concise and
      to the point. I'm happy to know people trained in web development
      are now (eventually) shown how to program in the functional style
      with JavaScript.</p>
      </section>
      <p>In JavaScript: Novice to Ninja, chapter 11 is devoted to all
      the cool things a JavaScript programmer can do with functions. It
      defines pure functions as follows:</p>
      <blockquote><p>A key aspect of functional programming is its use
      of pure functions. A pure function is a function that adheres to
      the following rules:</p>
        <ol class="rules">
          <li>The return value of a pure function should only depend on
          the values provided as arguments. It doesn't rely on values
          from somewhere else in the program.</li>
          <li>There are no side-effects. A pure function doesn't change
          any values or data elsewhere in the program. It only makes
          non-destructive data transformations and returns new values,
          rather than altering any of the underlying data.</li>
          <li> Referential transparency. Given the same arguments,
          a pure function will always return the same result.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In order to follow these rules, any pure function must
        have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At least one argument; otherwise the return value must
          depend on something other than the arguments of the function,
          breaking the first rule</li>
          <li>A return value; otherwise there’s no point in the function
          (unless it has changed something else in the program – in
          which case, it’s broken the 'no side-effects' rule).</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <section>
        <h2>Problems with the book's definitions.</h2>
      <p>I agree with most of this. Some of the rules are complex tests,
      so I'll divide them as I think a logician would interpret them:</p>
      <ol class="rules">
        <li><quote>The return value of a pure function should only depend
        on the values provided as arguments. It doesn't rely on values
        from somewhere else in the program.</quote>
          <p>This rule can be divided into the following tests:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Does the return value depend on the values provided as
            arguments? Expect yes if it is a pure function.</li>
            <li>Does the return value depend on values outside
            those provided as arguments? Expect no if it is a pure
            function.</li>
            <li>Does the return value rely on values from somewhere else
            in the program? Expect no if it is a pure function.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><quote>There are no side-effects. A pure function doesn't
        change any values or data elsewhere in the program. It only makes
        non-destructive data transformations and returns new values,
        rather than altering any of the underlying data.</quote>
          <p>This rule can be divided into the following tests:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Does it change data elsewhere in the program? Expect no
            if it is a pure function.</li>
            <li>Are any of its data transformations destructive? Expect
            no if it is a pure function.</li>
            <li>Does it return new values? Expect yes if it is a pure
            function.</li>
            <li>Does it alter any of the underlying data? Expect no if
            it is a pure function.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><quote>Referential transparency. Given the same arguments,
        a pure function will always return the same result.</quote>
          <p>This one is simple, so I won't divide it further. I'll just
          leave it at "For all x, does f(x) = f(x)?"</p>
        </li>
        <p>The problem I have is that these rules disqualify some things
        that I think anyone would agree are pure functions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Does the return value depend on the values provided as
          arguments? Expect yes if it is a pure function.</p>
            <p>Counterexample: <code>x=&gt;4</code></p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Does the return value depend on values outside those
          provided as arguments? Expect no if it is a pure function.</p>
            <p>Counterexample: <code>x=&gt;x+4</code></p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Does the return value rely on values from somewhere
          else in the program? Expect no if it is a pure function.</p>
            <p>Counterexample: <code>const c = 10;
              x=&gt;x+c</code></p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Does it change data elsewhere in the program? Expect
          no if it is a pure function.</p>
            <p>I cannot think of a counterexample for this rule.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Are any of its data transformations destructive? Expect
          no if it is a pure function.</p>
            <p>I cannot think of a counterexample for this rule.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Does it return new values? Expect yes if it is a pure
          function.</p>
            <p>Counterexample: <code>x=&gt;x</code> returns the original
            vale, not a new value.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Does it alter any of the underlying data? Expect no if
          it is a pure function.</p>
            <p>I cannot think of a counterexample for this rule.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>For all x, does f(x) = f(x)?</p>
            <p>I cannot think of a counterexample for this rule.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Along with these counterexamples, the requirement that a
        pure function have arguments is false. <code>()=&gt;4</code>
        is equivalent to <code>x=&gt;4</code> except the first accepts
        one unused argument and the other accepts zero. A more rigid
        definition of functional programming concepts would make it
        easier for students to understand what they are and will prevent
        misunderstandings when counterexamples like those above are
        encountered in the wild.</p>

      <section><h2>Problems I have with JavaScript's functional
      grammar</h2>
        <p>The book goes on to describe fundamental concepts like
        higher-order functions, which take and/or return functions, and
        currying, which is a technique to embed values in the function
        results of higher-order functions. I skipped the majority of it
        because I'm quote familiar with it, but I suppose I can explain
        how functional JavaScript is annoying compared to lisp.</p>
        <p>Consider the curried function
        <code>x=&gt;y=&gt;z=&gt;(x+y)/z</code>. This is some
        spicy Haskell-styled curry! I like it so far! In lisp
        this is <code>(lambda (x) (lambda (y) (lambda (z) (/
        (+ x y) z))))</code>. Don't get me started on how macros
        could make this shorter. Now suppose we want to quickly
        apply these lambdas and get a value. This is easy in lisp:
        <code>((((lambda (x) (lambda (y) (lambda (z) (/ (+ x y) z))))
        2) 5) 7)</code>. Simple and no harder to read or write than
        anything else in lisp. Now let's do the same thing in JavaScript:
        <code>(x=&gt;y=&gt;z=&gt;(x+y)/z)(2)(5)(7)</code>. What's
        this? I'm counting parentheses? Not only that, I'm counting
        pairs of parentheses! That doesn't need to happen in lisp! The
        curry is spoiled! Why am I not using lisp again?</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I have already done my best to use functional programming in
        all of my code in this portfolio, except for when I worked with
        a team who preferred the imperative style. I am confident enough
        in my understanding of functional programming that I decided
        to write this article. Ever since I learned about functional
        programming, I have encouraged its use, and am happy that,
        despite the language's heritage leading to poor design, it is
        possible to write pure functions in JavaScript.</p>
