    <ul>
      <li>Objects are structures of data and functions</li>
      <li>Objects are always mutable, even if they are declared with <code>const</code></li>
      <li>Objects can be declared literally or with a constructor</li>
      <li><code>this</code> refers to the object the current function is attached to.</li>
      <li>Namespaces are objects.</li>
      <li>Namespaces can be functional. Look at the Math namespace for an example.</li>
      <li>JSON is a serialization format.</li>
      <li>Date is used to get timestamp information</li>
      <li>Date was invented before getter functions could be attached to member variables</li>
      <li>RegExp is used for matching.</li>
      <li>RegExp objects can be declared like in ed.</li>
      <li>There was nothing in Chapter 5 I did not already know.</li>
      <li>DOM means Document Object Model</li>
      <li>DOM is useful for manipulating html and xml data.</li>
      <li>DOM represents everything as a tree.</li>
      <li>DOM is accessed through the <code>window.document</code> object.</li>
      <li><code>window</code> is the root "<code>this</code>" in a browser, so DOM can be accessed through the <code>document</code> object</li>
      <li><code>document</code> provides really long names for accessing everything. It's annoying</li>
      <li>I just use <code>document.querySelector</code> and <code>document.querySelectorAll</code> to access what I need.</li>
      <li>DOM can manipulate CSS-relevant properties.</li>
      <li>There is nothing in chapter 6 I did not already know.</li>
      <li>User inputs are handled with event listeners.</li>
      <li>Ways to set up event listeners include specifying them in the html, setting them up in objects, and using the "<code>addEventListener"</code> function of all nodes.</li>
      <li>Why does a recent javascript book use <code>alert</code> in its examples? Nobody who uses a web browser likes <code>alert</code>. Nobody. Likes. <code>alert</code>.</li>
      <li>There is nothing in chapter 7 I do not already know. I don't blame the course, I blame the university for not providing a way for me to "test out" of something I did as a student from 2011-2013 and professionally from 2015-2018.</li>
