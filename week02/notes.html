    <ul>
      <li><code>alert()</code> and <code>prompt()</code> are two very annoying functions, and I'm not sure why we continue to teach them to novice JavaScript programmers. They cause popdown messages that block the user's window and waste the user's time. Use well-placed divs instead.</li>
      <li>JavaScript loops are very similar to all other loops in every procedural programming language ever. I prefer the functional <code>map</code>, <code>foreach</code>, and <code>reduce</code>, because that allows me to avoid array index out of bounds errors.</li>
      <li>Structures included within javascript include arrays, sets, and maps.
        <ul>
          <li>arrays are lists declared between <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>. They behave like pythonic lists, except there are no list comprehensions in javascript yet.</li>
          <li>Sets are lists of unique elements. They can be created by making a <code>new Set</code> from an array of items. They are just like pythonic lists. There is no shorthand way to declare them in json.</li>
          <li>Maps are like pythonic dicts, except there are no list comprehensions in javascript yet. They map keys to values.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It is possible to match elements in an array Haskell-style. Neat!</li>
      <li>But element matching is not as strict...</li>
