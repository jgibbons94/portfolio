    <h2>Doing Stuff with Web Things</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>At one point, browsers used cookies to store data locally. They expired, and IINM they were always transferred from client to server. Now we use local storage for long-term and session storage for short-term. We also use IndexedDB when we want to store more complex data. At one point there was a proposal to standardize a SQLite API called webSQL.</li>

      <li>the only reason I need history in this case is to understand some of the practices that remain common to this day.</li>
      <li>Sites without backwards compatibility are "breaking the web"
        <li><a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/">The chart</a> says the most popular browsers on desktop and mobile are 99% compatible with ES6. The only features these most popular browsers don't have are not likely to be used by javascript developers unless those developers try a purely functional non-loopy style. Why is breaking the web considered a noteworthy issue?</li>
