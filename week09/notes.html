    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <h2>READING</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
      BOM lets programs work with browser and monitor.
      </li>
      <li>
      BOM has no official standard according to outdated book. Standard is actually described in HTML standard according to MDN.
      </li>
      <li>
      All global variables declared outside of modules belong to the <code>window</code> object.
      </li>
      <li>
      Outdated book shows off legacy code, including <code>alert</code>, <code>prompt</code>, and <code>confirm</code>
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>navigator</code> contains the <code>userAgent</code> value, which lets code discriminate by browser.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>navigator</code> also lets scripts identify available media capabilities, media sessions, mimetypes, permissions, platform, plugins, and other information that lets scripts adjust to capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>navigator</code> can be used to fingerprint, so there are security-oriented browsers and extensions designed to break expected conventions.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>location</code> contains information about the current URL and methods to change the current URL.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>history</code> lets links navigate through browser history. 
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>history</code> contains the number of pages the current tab has been to
      </li>
      <li>
      Data provided by <code>history</code> can be used with server logs to determine if the user was browsing in the current tab before navigating to the current page.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>window.open</code> can create a popup window, which is very annoying.
      </li>
      <li>
      I think most modern browsers just make <code>window.open</code> make a new tab, but I haven't tested it.
      </li>
      <li>
      Windows made from <code>window.open</code> can be closed in a script. This is still annoying.
      </li>
      <li>
      Don't use <code>window.open</code>, <code>window.move</code>, or <code>window.resize</code> if you want people to visit your site.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>window.screen</code> contains fingerprint data for the user's screen.
      </li>
      <li>
      I think <code>window.screen</code> has been replaced by css <code>@media</code> rules, because there's little legitimate use for <code>window.screen</code> outside styling.
      </li>
      <li>
      Cookies are data sent to the server and stored in the browser.
      </li>
      <li>
      Cookies are mostly replaced by the more secure <code>sessionStorage</code> and <code>localStorage</code> which don't transfer data with html.
      </li>
      <li>
      Cookies are still used for authentication.
      </li>
      <li>
      Cookies expire, get old, and crumble, but browser crashes may prevent this.
      </li>
      <li>
      Cookies set properties with strings. I think it's because they predate JSON.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>setTimeout</code> runs a function after the specified number of milliseconds.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>setInterval</code> runs a function every specified number of milliseconds.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>setInterval</code> might be used for animation.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is a better animation call because it calls the function on the next rendering frame.
      </li>
      <li>
      Timing functions return an id that can be used to cancel them.
      </li>
      <li>
      CSS is better for DOM animations than JS.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> is mostly useful for the <code>canvas</code> api.
      </li>
      <li>
      Lists of HTML/JS/CSS APIs, links to their specifications, known bugs, and statistics about their availability can be found at <a href="https://www.html5test.com">html5 test</a> and <a href="https://www.caniuse.com">can i use</a>
      </li>
      <li>
      These references are more up-to-date than the book.
      </li>
      <li>
      Attributes beginning with <code>data-</code> are officially supported.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>data-</code> attributes can have any name that begins with <code>data-</code> and meets the other xml tag requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
      <code>data-</code> attributes are for embedding any type of data.
      </li>
      <li>
      I've been using <code>localStorage</code> since week 1 of this course. <code>sessionStorage</code> is identical except it's deleted at the end of a session.
      </li>
      <li>
      Geolocation gives a program the user's location.
      </li>
      <li>
      I've seen it used for getting prices listed at local franchise establishments.
      </li>
      <li>
      I suppose it can also be used for an augmented reality mechanic like pokemon go.
      </li>
      <li>
      Web Workers are the response to JS being single threaded but websites needing heavy calculations.
      </li>
      <li>
      I don't think they're relevant anymore with async functions.
      </li>
      <li>
      The WebSockets API is a way to communicate with a server when the server thinks it's ready. It cuts out significant overhead and replaces XHRs in some instances like chatrooms.
      </li>
      <li>
      The Notifications API is a way to send notifications from a page running in the background to the desktop. 
      </li>
      <li>
      WebSockets and Notifications are often seen combined.
      </li>
      <li>
      Multimedia can be embedded with the
      <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>
      and
      <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
      tags.
      </li>
      <li>
      Multiple sources can be provided for a piece of media with
      <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>
      tags.
      </li>
      <li>
      The Web Audio API allows a programmer to run calculations on audio samples or generate audio streams.
      </li>
      <li>
      The GamePad API gets input from gamepads (game controllers) connected to the client.
      </li>
      <li>
      I used the GamePad API when I submitted a game to the Experimental Gameplay Project. I think that was back in 2012 or 2013. The resulting game wasn't particularly good, but I think I was able to effectively utilize an xbox 360 controller.
      </li>
      <li>
      I do not know the best way to handle outdated clients. Polyfills can be helpful I suppose, but they add latency when the client is up-to-date.
      I don't think it's worth supporting browsers more than 3 years old.
      </li>
